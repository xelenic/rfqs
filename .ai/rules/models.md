## A resumed rfq_steps stretch is not a new round
Putting an RFQ on hold or cancelling it ends its open stretches. Resuming it (Rfq::changeStatus → syncSteps(resuming: true)) starts new ones flagged `resumed`, which carry on the round before them. Anything that counts rounds or times a round (countdowns, deadlines, rounds/reworks) must group stretches with Rfq::roundsOf() or skip `resumed` ones. Otherwise a hold restarts the Sourcing target and shows up as a rework.

## Positional vs actionable part checks
RfqAssignment::isAwaiting…() and whereAwaiting…() say where a part stands, ignoring whether it's stopped (on hold or cancelled). Anything a role acts on or counts must also check ! isStopped() / RfqAssignment::whereActive(): partAwaits…(), queue rows, sidebar and queue counts. Rfq::whereAwaitingAt() keeps the whole-RFQ fallback row positional. "Every part is through" gates go through Rfq::everyLivePart(): cancelled parts don't count, held ones still do. Whole-RFQ actions are refused while a part is on hold (RfqController::abortIfPartOnHold()).

## Who can send back to whom lives in Rfq::RETURN_TARGETS
The business decided which role can return an RFQ to which earlier step (2026-10-06). Rfq::RETURN_TARGETS is the single source: rejectTargetStages(), the Reject modal's options and validation all read it. Never derive targets from REJECT_STAGE_ORDER ("everything earlier"); that rule was replaced. Returns go only to earlier steps, never to the role's own step or a later one. A new send-back must be added to RETURN_TARGETS, not hard-coded in a controller or view.
